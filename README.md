## How it works

We are using the formuala $$ π / 4 = Σ((-1)^(n+1) / (2n-1)) $$

[See how it works](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/d6fyv6zqzd)

## running

run
`./a.out [iterations]` or `.\a.exe [iterations]`
to calculate to a certain amount of iterations.

run
`./f.out` or `.\f.exe`
to calculate as much as possible (will use more cpu)
